Welcome to the GitHub repository for my final project. This project explores the evolving characteristics of popular music, focusing on audio features such as tempo, energy, danceability, and their relationship with song popularity over the decades. Utilizing data from Spotify's top tracks, this research aims to uncover trends and insights into what makes music popular.

### Project Description
This analysis provides an opportunity to delve into the evolution of popular music, identifying characteristics that contribute to a song's success over several decades. Insights derived from this analysis will not only enhance our understanding of popular music trends but also provide valuable context for future trends in the music industry.

### Research Questions

- What characteristics are common among the most popular songs?
- How have music trends shifted over time?
- Are there specific artists or genres that consistently produce top hits?
- To what extent can popularity be predicted based on these characteristics?

### Data Overview

The project uses two main datasets:
1. **Spotify All Time Top 2000s Mega Dataset**: Contains the top 2000 tracks on Spotify, spanning from 1956 to 2019, featuring a rich array of audio features.
